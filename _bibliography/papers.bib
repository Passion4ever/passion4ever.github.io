  abstract={Abstract It is a vital step to recognize cyanobacteria promoters on a genome-wide scale. Computational methods are promising to assist in difficult biological identification. When building recognition models, these methods rely on non-promoter generation to cope with the lack of real non-promoters. Nevertheless, the factitious significant difference between promoters and non-promoters causes over-optimistic prediction. Moreover, designed for E. coli or B. subtilis, existing methods cannot uncover novel, distinct motifs among cyanobacterial promoters. To address these issues, this work first proposes a novel non-promoter generation strategy called phantom sampling, which can eliminate the factitious difference between promoters and generated non-promoters. Furthermore, it elaborates a novel promoter prediction model based on the Siamese network (SiamProm), which can amplify the hidden difference between promoters and non-promoters through a joint characterization of global associations, upstream and downstream contexts, and neighboring associations w.r.t. k-mer tokens. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the superiority of our phantom sampling and SiamProm. Both comprehensive ablation studies and feature space illustrations also validate the effectiveness of the Siamese network and its components. More importantly, SiamProm, upon our phantom sampling, finds a novel cyanobacterial promoter motif (‘GCGATCGC’), which is palindrome-patterned, content-conserved, but position-shifted.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based molecule generation becomes a new paradigm of *de novo* molecule design since it enables fast and directional exploration in the vast chemical space. However, it is still an open issue to generate molecules, which bind to specific proteins with high-binding affinities while owning desired drug-like physicochemical properties. To address these issues, we elaborate a novel framework for controllable protein-oriented molecule generation, named CProMG, which contains a 3D protein embedding module, a dual-view protein encoder, a molecule embedding module, and a novel drug-like molecule decoder. Based on fusing the hierarchical views of proteins, it enhances the representation of protein binding pockets significantly by associating amino acid residues with their comprising atoms. Through jointly embedding molecule sequences, their drug-like properties, and binding affinities w.r.t. proteins, it autoregressively generates novel molecules having specific properties in a controllable manner by measuring the proximity of molecule tokens to protein residues and atoms. The comparison with state-of-the-art deep generative methods demonstrates the superiority of our CProMG. Furthermore, the progressive control of properties demonstrates the effectiveness of CProMG when controlling binding affinity and drug-like properties. After that, the ablation studies reveal how its crucial components contribute to the model respectively, including hierarchical protein views, Laplacian position encoding as well as property control. Last, a case study w.r.t. protein illustrates the novelty of CProMG and the ability to capture crucial interactions between protein pockets and molecules. It’s anticipated that this work can boost de novo molecule design.},
